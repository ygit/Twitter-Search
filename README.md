# Twitter-Search

This is a simple iOS Twitter client app that allows users to search Twitter, fetches & persistently saves that data and displays it on a table.


This is the solution project for the task:
Build a twitter search client which searches for all the tweets which contain the word ‘iOS’. This will include you creating an app on Twitter Developer Console and getting the Auth Keys. Fetch the search data and save it to Core Data and display it on a UITableView.
